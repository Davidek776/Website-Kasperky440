# Intent
My goal was to practise my gathered knowledge from HTML, CSS and recently learned SASS. I wanted to test my knowledge from Web-Design at the edge of my capabilities. That's why I've decided to build website based on Awwwards winning website <a href="https://www.awwwards.com/sites/social-foodies">SOCIAL FOODIES</a> created by Danish digital agency Checkmate Digitalt Bureau.

# Process
Creating this project I was strugling with few things, mostly while working on the responsivity of the website and organizing multiple Sass files.

# End Result
The result is landing website which from my point of view looks very simmilar, maybe even identical to original. When it comes to my personal progress, I believe that this project was huge step forward for me towards understanding and practising HTML, CSS and SASS. Website is also fully responsive. In the future I could possibly add there some extra functionality with JavaScript and also make it a dynamic website with backend and database.
